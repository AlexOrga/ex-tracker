# Ex-tracker

# Description
An app for me to keep track of my ex-girlfriends' most frequented locations so that I may stay away from them.  When clicking on any of the time of day buttons the locations will filter only showing the ones which correspond with your selection.  A search will also display corresponding locations to whatever you enter. This app also comes equipped with a "single ex view", click on any of the buttons located beneath the information about each of the individual exes and it will show you only the locations for that person.
